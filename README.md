# ANN-Experiment
I found that the initial weights have a very large influence on the speed of training, for some weights, it may take very long time to achieve the target error.
For the target error 0.1, the best learning rate is 0.7 from the range of 0.5 to 1, it has the smallest number of training batches.
For the target error 0.02, the best learning rate is 1.5 from the range of 0.5 to 2, it has the smallest number of training batches
